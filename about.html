      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="subtext">Carpe diem is an independent, non-profit initiative founded by students, for students. Our goal is to provide students with accessible opportunities to explore their interests, outside of structurally academic settings. 
Secondary education can be a turning point for many people, as curriculums often demand students to choose a singular pathway before having any real-life experience in their chosen areas. Motivated by this sense of uncertainty, we decided to create this platform to give people a chance to truly discover what excites them—not through constant self-doubt and confusion—but through tangible actions. A diverse range of activities and resources were compiled into a user-friendly interface, enabling students of all areas to find an activity suitable for them.
Truth be told, this project was built on top of a mountain of failures. Countless ambitious projects that didn’t work out, collaborations that fell through, all in all, failed experimentations led to the creation of Carpe Diem. Nevertheless, each one of those experiences turned into something valuable and built the foundation for this project. 
Our mission is simple: to encourage students to act on their interests. By making this exploratory journey more approachable through focusing on locally accessible opportunities, we hope to inspire students to pursue meaningful experiences, ones that will shape their future with confidence and purpose.
