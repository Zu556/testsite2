        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Start 2–3 months early (6 months to 1 year is ideal). Consider internships, competitions, and projects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Internships / Volunteering: similar to mini job positions, apply 3-4 months before your expected start date</li>
            <li>Competitions:can require months of preparation depending on the type of competition you participate in. Give yourself enough time to practice if it’s a test-based competition.</li>
            <li>Projects: whether it’s a personal passion project or a project you’re planning for a competition/contest, you will inevitably run into periods of trial-and-error, so be very generous with time. The higher your project’s complexity is, the more time you should give to yourself.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>School can feel extra demanding if you overcrowd your schedule with too many extracurricular activities, so please plan wisely. The best time to carry out your extracurricular activities is in the summer, when there aren’t any pressures for deadlines. During planning, it can be a good idea to try to avoid any overlap with particularly stressful moments that you might have at school. (i.e. final exams)</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>The worst they can say is no [or they can just never reply]. When you email people for a volunteering position or an internship position, be very clear about what you want to do and when you want to do it. (i.e. observational internship, mini-project, collaboration for you own initiative)<p>
          <p>People are usually nice when responding to emails from a curious young student, so don’t shy away from contacting anyone. Attach a resume with previous experience when you’re applying to internships. Rejections are the norm, but you only need one ‘’yes’’ to make things happen. Sometimes you just need to send a dozen emails to different people.<p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Careful planning is essential to avoid pressure and stress, juggling both school and your chosen activity can be difficult. If you’re struggling academically, aim for things that can be done in a few weeks during the summer. Alternatively, space out your tasks for a project as much as possible, adding up to no more than 3-5 hours per week.</p>
          <p>When planning your schedule, you should have a rough idea of what the activity will entail. For instance, a physical labor-based volunteering activity might leave you with no energy to study at the end of your shift. In that case, you should block out those weeks entirely, or for lighter tasks only. <p>
          <p>For more complex projects, you should have a timeline consisting of the tasks your project will require, then distribute them evenly. i.e.  For a laboratory based experimental project:<p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Research for your methodology [usually this takes quite a while] </li>
            <li>2.  ask if your teacher can mentor you. If not, look for help elsewhere </li>
            <li>3. Order the necessary materials [include time leniency for late arrivals] </li>
            <li>4. Ask your school’s laboratory if they’re willing to accommodate you, otherwise email other labs months in advance </li>
            <li>5. Give enough time to your experiment, there’s bound to be some trial and error here</li>
            <li>6. Writing up the report can take around 15-20 hours, distribute these hours evenly. Try not to cram everything in a single night. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can clearly see that each of these steps can [and probably will] involve some unexpected events that require extra time. Thus, to avoid stress, you really should plan 4-5 months in advance for more complex projects: especially for ones that will require you to learn a new skill. <p>
